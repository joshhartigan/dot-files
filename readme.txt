these files are for customising things.
this readme contains comments on certain things.

#### MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION ####

I like Vim. I am also beginning to learn Emacs.
I use OS X on a Macbook Pro 2014 13 inch.
I have also used Linux (Crunchbang and Arch mainly), and though I find the
customisation fun, it is sometimes too time consuming.

I change color schemes in everything all the time.


#### ON PROMPTS #####

I am quite strongly against shell prompts like this: http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/normal.png

I want to know what directory I'm in. I'd like it to look nice.
I *don't* need to be reminded what my name is.
I don't care what time it is, and if I wanted to know, I have a clock.
If I need to know what git branch I'm on... `git branch`


#### ON EDITORS ####

http://peabody.weeman.org/editor_wars.html

I honestly couldn't care less anymore about the 'editor wars'. I started with TextWrangler,
I moved onto Sublime Text, now I use Vim with some Emacs on the side. If I need a modern GUI
I'll use Atom, if I need an IDE I'll use a JetBrains product, and if I'm on a new Linux install
I'll use nano. I don't care what editor you use, but I am interested in it if you have customised
it to a large extent as I like to customise things. There are more important things in the world
than which program somebody uses to edit data.


#### ON OPERATING SYSTEMS ####

I feel sorry for anyone forced into using the confining, bloated, ugly and buggy mess that is Windows.
Each iteration of that operating system seems to roll itself further and further down a slippery slope
towards hell.
I don't think there is a good operating system. OS X is proprietary and Apple often make insane decisions;
it does look nice though. GNU/Linux cannot really be judged as one system because of all of the distributions.
  * Arch Linux is the best distro, though it takes too long to learn how to set it up.
  * CrunchBang is good but comes with things I don't want, and is discontinued.
  * Ubuntu is the Windows of the Linux world. Some derivatives such as Lubuntu and Mint are fine and exceptional for beginners.
The Plan 9 operating system would be good had it any support for anything, and any sort of actual ecosystem.


#### ON COMPUTERS ####

They're all stupid.
