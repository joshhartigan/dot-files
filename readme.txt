these files are for customising things.

I like Vim. I am also beginning to learn Emacs.
I use OS X on a Macbook Pro 2014 13 inch.
I have also used Linux (Crunchbang and Arch mainly), and though I find the
customisation fun, it is sometimes too time consuming.

I change color schemes in everything all the time.
