### dotfiles

these files are for customising things.
this readme contains comments on certain things.

#### MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION

I like Vim. I am also beginning to learn Emacs.
  I use OS X on a Macbook Pro 2014 13 inch.
  I have also used Linux (Crunchbang and Arch mainly), and though I find the
customisation fun, it is sometimes too time consuming.

I change color schemes in everything all the time.


#### ON PROMPTS #####

I am quite strongly against shell prompts like this: http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/normal.png

I want to know what directory I'm in. I'd like it to look nice.
  I *don't* need to be reminded what my name is.
  I don't care what time it is, and if I wanted to know, I have a clock.
  If I need to know what git branch I'm on... `git branch`


#### ON EDITORS

http://peabody.weeman.org/editor_wars.html

I honestly couldn't care less anymore about the 'editor wars'. I started with TextWrangler,
  I moved onto Sublime Text, now I use Vim with some Emacs on the side. If I need a modern GUI
  I'll use Atom, if I need an IDE I'll use a JetBrains product, and if I'm on a new Linux install
  I'll use nano. I don't care what editor you use, but I am interested in it if you have customised it to a large extent as I like to customise things. There are more important things in the world than which program somebody uses to edit data.


#### ON COMPUTERS

They're all stupid.
